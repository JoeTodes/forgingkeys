You need to be able to protect these creatures somehow and if not, you leave yourself very vulnerable to being blown out by your opponent with a large amber swing if they wipe your board.

As a reminder, Warding is an action done through various means (Reaping, playing cards, etc) and involves placing a Ward token on a creature. If that creature were to be destroyed, change locations, or dealt damage then negate that effect and remove the ward counter. This is especially powerful when you’re warding the creature that you’re exalting. Get extra value through your creature’s actions that your opponent will have a tough time dealing with. Excellent! Ward seemed particularly powerful and very troublesome to deal with. Back to the game I played.. After the big board wipe (and massive Amber swing in my favour), Shae built up his board again and started warding all his creatures over a few turns. At first I didn’t pay much mind to all the wards until it was too late. I kept to my deck’s plan of racing and ignoring Shae’s creatures. After a few turns he had a good 5 or so creature out on board, warded, and unstoppable. There was no good or easy way to deal with them with my deck. They were essentially on the table for good. I would have essentially needed multiple board wipes or attacked with at least two creatures into each warded creature to eliminate them, which I didn’t have. The best ward decks will need a variety of answers to defeat them or else their fate will be determined before the game has even started.
