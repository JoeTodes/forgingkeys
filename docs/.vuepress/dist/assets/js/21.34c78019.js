This is especially powerful when you’re warding the creature that you’re exalting. Get extra value through your creature’s actions that your opponent will have a tough time dealing with. Excellent! Ward seemed particularly powerful and very troublesome to deal with. Back to the game I played.. After the big board wipe (and massive aember swing in my favour), Shea built up his board again and started warding all his creatures over a few turns. At first I didn’t pay much mind to all the wards until it was too late. I kept to my deck’s plan of racing and ignoring Shea’s creatures. After a few turns he had a good 5 or so creature out on board, warded, and unstoppable. There was no good or easy way to deal with them with my deck. They were essentially on the table for good. I would have essentially needed multiple board wipes or attacked with at least two creatures into each warded creature to eliminate them, which I didn’t have.
