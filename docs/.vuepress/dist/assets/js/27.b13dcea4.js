A simple board wipe is good but on your opponent’s next turn they are able to restock the board and regain a good portion of the tempo lost from the board wipe. The new set, especially the new houses, have so many good value creatures that have great text boxes. They do things on entering the playing field plus do other things on reaping and fighting. Some are even able to buff their neighbours. I was posting on Twitter over the last week about how good the Dinos in Saurian can be. A few times this week I’ve passed the turn with 2-4 creatures on board and in check. Pass turn. My opponent forges a key, plays some dinos, and before I’ve even had a sip of my coffee my board has been wiped, I’ve gone from 7 Aember to 1, they have added more dinos to their heard, and are in check again.
